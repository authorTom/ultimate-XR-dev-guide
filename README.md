<br>
I created this resource list for my personal use. I hope you find it useful too. Much of the content overlaps with general game development, and there is an emphasis on Unreal Engine and Meta Quest headsets. <br />
<br>
**24th February 2024: Added links for visionOS - It has been some time since my last update, and the Apple Vision Pro has now been officially released.<br />**

### Photogrammetry
Photogrammetry is a technique that uses photographs to construct 3D models of objects, buildings, or landscapes. The process involves taking multiple photos of the subject from various angles and then analysing them with specialised software to generate a 3D model. <br />
